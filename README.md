# Hive Network

Hive Network is intended to establish the underlying protocol stack of a trusted network. 



## Introduction

***In Hive Network, we use technology to do meaningful things rather than do technical things.***

Over the years, we have experienced too many bad things, such as wars, plagues. Ordinary people are like swim bladders in waves. The information we receive is always untraceable. Even a lot of information is rumors, which greatly hurts the trust connection at the social level. 

The news we see produced by the media is based on current Internet communication protocols such as HTTP. But these protocols cannot guarantee the authenticity of the news and cannot provide a reliable source of information. 

*Someone is lying and we must stop them.*

Imagine if there were network communication protocols and infrastructure to prove the authenticity and reliability of information, the information entropy of our society would drop drastically. We think and make decisions based on reliable information that will result in a fair, equal and free Internet, and even a better society.

Hive Network is to do such a network protocol and infrastructure. You can get real and reliable information just by visiting the Hive URL, such as `hive://truth`. You don't need to spend time making sure the information is really authentic. The underlying logic of Hive Network already ensures that information can be trusted. There is no doubt that such a network protocol will be needed in the future digital society and even the metaverse.

The early version of Hive Network will build a trusted network based on blockchain and cross-chain technology. But in the future, Hive Network will not be limited to blockchain technology, because we know that better technology will be born. The wheels of history are rolling now. The trusted network has been an inevitable result of the development of the Internet.
